# Bias Detection Project Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts that are included as part of our bias detection project for CS 8803 Conversational AI (Fall 2024).

Here is a demo video (sometimes the deployed app has issues): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yoEhFdQ5TMU-xHkGoqXeBlRMhegXGtRa/view?usp=drive_link

The application is deployed here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/GT-CAI-F2024/CAI-experimental 

We show a conversation with biases in the past, and see it being flagged after the last user message
