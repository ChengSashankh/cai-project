Alinsky wrote, in Rules for Radicals (emphasis added): \u201cThe standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be.\u201d Michelle Obama said: \u201cAnd Barack stood up that day, and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since. He talked about \u2018the world as it is\u2018 and \u2018the world as it should be.'\u201d (Perhaps Mr. Obama who left out the attribution.)",

The gods of the OT and NT are opposites. The two halves of the Bible are mirror images of each other. Jews follow an ideology based on materialistic rule, physical domination, superiority, hate, secrecy, and deception. Compare the story of the sign of Jonah and Jesus/Pharisees asking for a sign with its opposite in the OT, the killing of Isaac. Pharisees ask Jesus to prove to them that he is God, even after witnessing many miracles. They have no faith. Abraham is willing to please God (not the same god) and kill his beloved son just because god asked him to. He is willing to follow god (yahweh, satan) blindly and commit an evil act. The sign of jonah refers to the idea that faith in God (the Christian one, the God of love) is not something given conditionally. The seeker of truth must observe carefully, God is imminent in all things. The OT God is the God of the material world/time, Moloch/Chronos/Saturn/finiteness/entropy, whereas the God of the NT is the God of the spiritual world/the infinite/the immortal soul/unconditional love/renewal/enlightenment.",

[John Crawford III slaying, Tamir Rice slaying]He knew that they should they choose to dust him, they do so without fear of repercussion [Freddie Gray slaying, Eric Garner slaying].That precedent encourages them to take the safest action for themselves, i.e. killing him immediately, then destroying/planting evidence [Walter Scott slaying], dropping body cams [Alton Sterling slaying], etc.Thus as soon as the cop cars roll up it is quite reasonable for him to be IN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.

I really don't put that much value on MUH POLITICAL VOICE anyway, if the price for the same thing would be what we're experiencing now. I mostly trust men in case of politics since they've shown to be much more reasonable when choosing for what and who they vote for, and just taking a glance through history I come to know that all great civilizations were created by men and men alone.Though as I said, (((democracy))).I'd prefer either a national socialist state or a monarchy much more.",

We have realized that our grandparents lived qualitatively better, happier lives than we or our parents do. The link to White Nationalism comes from our rejection of egalitarianism and the claim that diversity is a benefit to society. We accept that differences in behavior are due largely to inherited genetic differences which are the result of natural selection acting on geographically isolated populations, different environments naturally selecting for the traits most beneficial for survival therein. We hold that what you call 'racism' is simply an evolved psychological mechanism which has aided the survival of our ancestors for millennia, as those who avoided foreign tribes tended to live longer and produce more offspring. Whereas the Left see this tendency as 'problematic' we see it as perfectly natural, where the Left thinks it best to attempt to alter or 'overcome' human nature (or deny the existence of human nature entirely) we think that meddling with these things will only lead to larger problems.",

Either vote for Clinton who will have more pro-corporate/anti-labor trade and immigration policies, or vote for Trump who will have more anti-corporate/pro-labor trade and immigration policies.Theoretically the choices are two:1. If Clinton wins, Trump will keep doing what he's doing, and immigration and trade will stay balanced pro-corporate/anti-labor the way the status quo is now.2. If Trump wins, immigration and trade policy will shift in a more anti-corporate/pro-labor direction, and this will impact all businesses, including Trump's.So if you are pro-labor/anti-corporate, the way the Berniebot Occupy Democrats say they are, then you would logically vote for Trump, and where he makes his ties is irrelevant.But that is way too complex to explain to the public, unless you control a TV station and you can harp on it every day and help the public get up the learning curve.

We can triangulate this information to figure out what messaging to use in order to: Win new voters over to Trump Increase excitement among current supporters, to increase turnout Decrease excitement among current supporters of the opponent, to decrease turnoutEveryone involved in politics knows that this race will be impossible to predict EVEN IF THE OUTCOME ISN'T CLOSE. It will come down to who gets their people to the polls. The Trump campaign is very happy with the current state of the race.

One of the trucks was intercepted by Brazilian Federal Police at the state of Minas Gerais, the other one is missing, probably still going to Rio de Janeiro.

Nationalism has caught on, and is gaining globally. Gaining control of central and or eastern Europe doesn't go very far toward miscegenation either, unless the unified territory were to be used as a giant spillover for millions more rapefugees from Africa and the ME.There's the angle worth gaming out.",

If you want to get into trading, you have to learn that markets are essentially irrational, which means they tend to over/underprice certain events which in turn affects stock evaluation.

The progressive era of the early 1900s actually saw populism go as far as to attempt to circumvent the legislative process altogether altogether, with many states developing the ballot initiative and referendum process.The framers absolutely intended that suffrage be intended for property holding, white males of good moral character and community standing.

            "USER: Should women have the right to vote? I find myself wanting to answer no to the question for many reasons.women are more emotional than logicalthey have no sense of pride (national or otherwise)they will do whatever it takes to have peace, even if it means getting run overmost importantly, they are not directly involved or affected by politics the way men are. Men HAVE to work. Men HAVE to go to war. Etc.However, in order to allow for a true democracy all citizens must be able to vote. How can it be a real democracy with more than half the population not being allowed to vote?Can you guys help me answer this question?",
