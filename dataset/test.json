While the territory of the Baltic plains itself offers little in the way of race-averaging or border weakening, since they are already exposed to the infiltration subsuming the EU, decimating the Russian conventional military threat to western Europe would force Russia to either expend its nuclear option, which would mean suicide, or accept terms which would summarily turn Russia itself into a client state of the EU.Such a result would eliminate the last resistance of a relatively un-averaged, pale-skinned, self-sustaining ethnicity, as well as unlock one of the most intransigent borders remaining between the black team and its world-wide goals.Moscow, Petersburg, all the way to Yaaroslavl and Kamchatka would be open to stream refugees from the increasingly chaotic, and remember, simultaneous, chain of failing states in Africa and the Middle East, which by then will have pushed (continuing current trends) to the borders of South Africa, and to the outposts of US best buddy Liberia, limited on continental terms only by the presence of the Sahara desert. An encircled KSA, pleading its case to US generals, would be happy to oblige in flexing its newly proven capabilities in the war torn former territories of Syria, Iraq, and oh look Jordan, Egypt and Libya.Speculation even tempts the idea that sufficient chaos would precipitate the much-ballyhooed final hot showdown between KSA the Islamic Republic.....",

            "USER: A response to your petition on Black Lives MatterThanks for participating on the We the People platform.You recently signed a petition asking the Administration to Formally recognize Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization.In the wake of the tragic recent events in Dallas, Falcon Heights, and Baton Rouge, the President brought together law enforcement officials, civil rights leaders, activists, faith leaders, academics, and state and local elected officials this week to encourage frank conversations about the steps we can take together to build trust and ensure justice for all Americans. As part of these conversations, the President directly addressed the concern that the Black Lives Matter slogan, social media movement, and the associated protests are somehow inherently anti-police:I know that there are some who have criticized even the phrase 'black lives matter,' as if the notion is, is that other lives don't matter. And so you get 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter.' I understand the point they're trying to make. I think it's important for us to also understand that the phrase 'black lives matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African Americans that needs to be addressed. It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter. It's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability.And so we shouldn't get too caught up in this notion that somehow people who are asking for fair treatment are somehow, automatically, anti-police, are trying to only look out for black lives as opposed to others. I think we have to be careful about playing that game, just because that's not obviously what is intended.(1/2)",

Japan and Greece have a ton of smokers, but they do not see it as a noticeable health risk or detriment, and they don't believe in secondhand smoke for the most part.Smoking is attacked in order to social engineer people, and to raise profits for the pharmaceutical industry and shift blame from actual pollutants.

You can flee to the suburbs, and still live in something resembling traditional America. Blacks have fallen below replacement rates. Their population is set to decline or stagnate.Hispanics on the other hand are rapidly growing. If America has a large chunk of Hispanics in it, it's no longer America. I'm not a stormfag, but America needs to remain majority white, and Hispanics are the largest threat to that.On the topic of peaceful coexistence, I disagree. If the number of Hispanics was much smaller, then sure. It's not, though. Multiple studies have linked diversity to the loss of social cohesion and trust.

Not the individual nations, but the EU is extremely keen on the idea and is also keen on TTiP, as is Clinton.",

You can flee to the suburbs, and still live in something resembling traditional America. Blacks have fallen below replacement rates. Their population is set to decline or stagnate.Hispanics on the other hand are rapidly growing. If America has a large chunk of Hispanics in it, it's no longer America. I'm not a stormfag, but America needs to remain majority white, and Hispanics are the largest threat to that.On the topic of peaceful coexistence, I disagree. If the number of Hispanics was much smaller, then sure. It's not, though. Multiple studies have linked diversity to the loss of social cohesion and trust.

If you wish to blame him for that, may I remind you that such a right SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.When the police descended upon him in force in response to some citizen's misguided 911 call, he realized that there was a high likelihood that he would be slain, quite likely immediately before he could even say one word. [John Crawford III slaying, Tamir Rice slaying]He knew that they should they choose to dust him, they do so without fear of repercussion [Freddie Gray slaying, Eric Garner slaying]. That precedent encourages them to take the safest action for themselves, i.e. killing him immediately, then destroying/planting evidence [Walter Scott slaying], dropping body cams [Alton Sterling slaying], etc.Thus as soon as the cop cars roll up it is quite reasonable for him to be IN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.

An encircled KSA, pleading its case to US generals, would be happy to oblige in flexing its newly proven capabilities in the war torn former territories of Syria, Iraq, and oh look Jordan, Egypt and Libya.Speculation even tempts the idea that sufficient chaos would precipitate the much-ballyhooed final hot showdown between KSA the Islamic Republic.....",

Jews follow an ideology based on materialistic rule, physical domination, superiority, hate, secrecy, and deception. Compare the story of the sign of Jonah and Jesus/Pharisees asking for a sign with its opposite in the OT, the killing of Isaac. Pharisees ask Jesus to prove to them that he is God, even after witnessing many miracles. They have no faith. Abraham is willing to please God (not the same god) and kill his beloved son just because god asked him to. He is willing to follow god (yahweh, satan) blindly and commit an evil act. The sign of jonah refers to the idea that faith in God (the Christian one, the God of love) is not something given conditionally. The seeker of truth must observe carefully, God is imminent in all things. The OT God is the God of the material world/time, Moloch/Chronos/Saturn/finiteness/entropy, whereas the God of the NT is the God of the spiritual world/the infinite/the immortal soul/unconditional love/renewal/enlightenment.",

As part of these conversations, the President directly addressed the concern that the Black Lives Matter slogan, social media movement, and the associated protests are somehow inherently anti-police:I know that there are some who have criticized even the phrase 'black lives matter,' as if the notion is, is that other lives don't matter. And so you get 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter.' I understand the point they're trying to make. I think it's important for us to also understand that the phrase 'black lives matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African Americans that needs to be addressed. It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter. It's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability.And so we shouldn't get too caught up in this notion that somehow people who are asking for fair treatment are somehow, automatically, anti-police, are trying to only look out for black lives as opposed to others.

If we're going to say that SAMs can engage ground targets, then the Soviets and now Russia have had far more systems in place for decades well before this was deployed. So following your line of logic that SAMs can be used for land attack, then Russia has been doing this for decades and NATO is now just deciding to do it in response. What's the issue?",

As part of these conversations, the President directly addressed the concern that the Black Lives Matter slogan, social media movement, and the associated protests are somehow inherently anti-police:I know that there are some who have criticized even the phrase 'black lives matter,' as if the notion is, is that other lives don't matter. And so you get 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter.' I understand the point they're trying to make. I think it's important for us to also understand that the phrase 'black lives matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African Americans that needs to be addressed. It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter. It's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability.And so we shouldn't get too caught up in this notion that somehow people who are asking for fair treatment are somehow, automatically, anti-police, are trying to only look out for black lives as opposed to others. I think we have to be careful about playing that game, just because that's not obviously what is intended.(1/2)",

[John Crawford III slaying, Tamir Rice slaying]He knew that they should they choose to dust him, they do so without fear of repercussion [Freddie Gray slaying, Eric Garner slaying].That precedent encourages them to take the safest action for themselves, i.e. killing him immediately, then destroying/planting evidence [Walter Scott slaying], dropping body cams [Alton Sterling slaying], etc.Thus as soon as the cop cars roll up it is quite reasonable for him to be IN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.

[John Crawford III slaying, Tamir Rice slaying]He knew that they should they choose to dust him, they do so without fear of repercussion [Freddie Gray slaying, Eric Garner slaying].That precedent encourages them to take the safest action for themselves, i.e. killing him immediately, then destroying/planting evidence [Walter Scott slaying], dropping body cams [Alton Sterling slaying], etc.Thus as soon as the cop cars roll up it is quite reasonable for him to be IN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.

The gods of the OT and NT are opposites. The two halves of the Bible are mirror images of each other. Jews follow an ideology based on materialistic rule, physical domination, superiority, hate, secrecy, and deception. Compare the story of the sign of Jonah and Jesus/Pharisees asking for a sign with its opposite in the OT, the killing of Isaac. Pharisees ask Jesus to prove to them that he is God, even after witnessing many miracles. They have no faith. Abraham is willing to please God (not the same god) and kill his beloved son just because god asked him to. He is willing to follow god (yahweh, satan) blindly and commit an evil act. The sign of jonah refers to the idea that faith in God (the Christian one, the God of love) is not something given conditionally. The seeker of truth must observe carefully, God is imminent in all things. The OT God is the God of the material world/time, Moloch/Chronos/Saturn/finiteness/entropy, whereas the God of the NT is the God of the spiritual world/the infinite/the immortal soul/unconditional love/renewal/enlightenment.",

When trump gets elected, we have to make sure he follows through and builds that wall, for example. And one of the reasons why is because a physical wall is permanent and can't be easily undone with the flick of a pen when the next guy comes to office. But that out of the way, it's important to keep pushing further to the right. Trump is our springboard. We've already seen the overton window shift to the right with him. We need to keep it going to the right. We can't just wash our hands and walk away after he's elected, because then it would slide back to the left.

Child soldiers have been used in many conflicts the world over and images like this are then used in the propaganda war against the enemy. Also, your argument that the rebels are the only people who have used child soldiers in this conflict with the glaring evidence that the rebels are executing a child soldier (probably not the first) from the other side is moot.",

We have realized that our grandparents lived qualitatively better, happier lives than we or our parents do. The link to White Nationalism comes from our rejection of egalitarianism and the claim that diversity is a benefit to society. We accept that differences in behavior are due largely to inherited genetic differences which are the result of natural selection acting on geographically isolated populations, different environments naturally selecting for the traits most beneficial for survival therein. We hold that what you call 'racism' is simply an evolved psychological mechanism which has aided the survival of our ancestors for millennia, as those who avoided foreign tribes tended to live longer and produce more offspring. Whereas the Left see this tendency as 'problematic' we see it as perfectly natural, where the Left thinks it best to attempt to alter or 'overcome' human nature (or deny the existence of human nature entirely) we think that meddling with these things will only lead to larger problems.",

I dislike going into town sometimes when I just want to grab a few things, but every single person I meet is all smiles and wants to ask how I'm doing, and then they don't really even care how I'm doing, they just ask while smiling and not really paying attention.

I'm not a stormfag, but America needs to remain majority white, and Hispanics are the largest threat to that.On the topic of peaceful coexistence, I disagree. If the number of Hispanics was much smaller, then sure. It's not, though. Multiple studies have linked diversity to the loss of social cohesion and trust.

When trump gets elected, we have to make sure he follows through and builds that wall, for example. And one of the reasons why is because a physical wall is permanent and can't be easily undone with the flick of a pen when the next guy comes to office. But that out of the way, it's important to keep pushing further to the right. Trump is our springboard. We've already seen the overton window shift to the right with him. We need to keep it going to the right. We can't just wash our hands and walk away after he's elected, because then it would slide back to the left.
